## My process

First I started by analyzing the design files so I can group my elements and also be able to give class names to similar style elements.
Secondly, I started writing the HTML for the design so I could structure my document very well.
Then I started adding styles for the general elements like body, and general classes.
Then I started styling my elements from top to button.
Lastly, I styled it for it to be responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
